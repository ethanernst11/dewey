## 🏗 Architecture

### Monorepo Layout
```
apps/
├── web/                    # Next.js web experience (existing UI)
└── ios/                    # Placeholder for native SwiftUI codebase

contracts/
├── openapi.yaml            # Shared API contract
└── schemas/                # JSON Schemas consumed by web + Swift clients

tools/
└── test_api/               # Python scripts for Gray Whale experimentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- [Gray Whale AI](https://graywhale.ai) API access token

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the web app**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME=dewey
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=your_gray_whale_token
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### iOS (Swift) Setup

1. **Open the Xcode workspace** (placeholder directory for now)
   ```bash
   open apps/ios
   ```
2. Consume the shared API definitions from `contracts/` when implementing models and networking.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the API tools directory**
   ```bash
   cd tools/test_api
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file or set environment variables
   export PROJECT_NAME=dewey
   export ACCESS_TOKEN=your_gray_whale_token
   export USER=your_username
   export PASS=your_password
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install requests uuid
   ```

4. **Run the API**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **Personalized Feed**
- Each user gets a unique session ID
- [Gray Whale AI](https://graywhale.ai) generates initial recommendations using their foundational model
- Real-time updates based on user interactions

### 2. **Linger Tracking Magic**
- **Intersection Observer** tracks which books users view
- **Time-based metrics** measure engagement (minimum 100ms)
- **Behavioral data** sent to Gray Whale for improved recommendations
- **Enter count** tracks repeated views of the same book

### 3. **Smart Search**
- Natural language processing through Gray Whale
- Context-aware results that understand intent
- Real-time refinement based on search history

### 4. **Library Management**
- Local storage for instant access
- Three reading states: Want to Read, Reading, Read
- Easy status transitions with visual feedback

## 🔧 Key Components

### `useRecommendations` Hook
- Manages recommendation fetching and state
- Integrates linger tracking data
- Handles infinite scroll and pagination
- Converts Gray Whale API responses to frontend models

### `useLingerTracking` Hook
- Tracks user engagement with book cards
- Uses Intersection Observer for accurate viewport detection
- Generates behavioral events for Gray Whale API
- Optimized for performance with minimal overhead

### `RecommendationService`
- Handles all Gray Whale API communication
- Manages authentication and error handling
- Formats requests and responses
- Supports both live and mock data modes

## 📊 Features in Detail

### Linger Tracking System
The linger tracking system is a sophisticated behavioral analysis tool that:

- **Monitors viewport intersection** at 50% visibility threshold
- **Tracks multiple metrics**: total time viewed, enter count, session data
- **Sends intelligent events** to Gray Whale for recommendation improvement
- **Resets appropriately** on new searches to maintain relevance

### Real-time Recommendations
- **Session-based personalization** with UUID generation
- **Event-driven updates** using linger data
- **Batch loading** with configurable page sizes
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
